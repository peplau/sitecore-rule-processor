# Sitecore Rule Processor

With Sitecore Rule Processor you can test and execute Sitecore Rules, without having to go thru their pipelines.

Sitecore Rules are nativaly triggered only when certain events happens. With this module you'll be able to test rules (list the items that matches) and process them (executing the rule actions against matching items).

Example of usage:

1. Create a new Rule
2. Setup the conditions and some of the useful actions that comes with the module (more to come!)
3. When a Rule item is selected you now have the Rule Processor button. When this button is clicked the Rule Processor window opens
4. Set the Root Item and click on Bring results to list the items that matches your Rule
5. You can execute the Rule's Actions against all matching items, or only with those you selected
